Supply Chain DApp with Metamask
Overview
This is a capstone project for a supply chain decentralized application (DApp) built using Ethereum, Solidity, and JavaScript. The DApp aims to create transparency and trust in the construction chemical supply chain by allowing users, including manufacturers, suppliers, and end-users (customers), to track the quality and authenticity of products.

Features
Supply Chain Tracking
Manufacturers: Manufacturers can upload product information, quality test results, and certifications to the Ethereum blockchain.

Suppliers: Suppliers can record product shipments, receipts, and any inspections conducted during transit.

Customers (End-users): Customers can verify the authenticity and quality of products by scanning QR codes or inputting product information.

User Types
Manufacturer: Manufacturers can log in and upload product details, quality data, and certifications. They can track their products through the supply chain.

Supplier: Suppliers can log in to record shipment and receipt information. They can also perform inspections during transit and update the blockchain with relevant data.

Customer (End-user): End-users can log in to verify product authenticity and quality by accessing blockchain data.

Metamask Integration
The DApp integrates with Metamask, a popular Ethereum wallet and gateway to blockchain applications, allowing users to interact securely with the Ethereum network.
Web GUI
The DApp provides a user-friendly web interface built using [Frontend Framework], enabling users to log in, access their respective profiles, and fetch data based on their roles.
